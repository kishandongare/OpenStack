# What is OpenStack ?

>> OpenStack is open source and free software for building cloud Computing or it is a Cloud Operating System that is used to control the large pools of computing, storage, and networking resources within a data center and provisioned through OpenStack APIs with common authentication mechanisms.

>> It is programmable infrastructure as a service that allows users to have one platform for virtual machines, containers and bare metal. It helps to  control a data center with the help of a web-based dashboard or command-line tools.
# Virtual Machine vs Containers ?

>> Virtual machines have a host operating system and a guest operating system inside each VM. The guest OS can be any OS, such as Linux or Windows, irrespective of the host OS. 

>> In contrast, Docker containers are hosted on a single physical server with the host OS shared among them. Sharing the host OS between containers makes them light and decreases the boot time. Docker containers are considered suitable to run multiple applications over a single OS kernel; whereas, virtual machines are needed if the applications or services are required to run on different OS.

# What is bare metal ?

>> The term bare metal is a reference to a computer’s hard disk – the medium on which the operating system (OS) is installed. A bare-metal environment is a specific kind of virtualization environment built with bare-metal hypervisors that do not rely on a host OS in order to function. 

>> In a bare-metal environment, the virtualization hypervisor is installed and executed directly on the hard drive (bare metal) and can create virtual machines (VMs) from there, just as in a virtualized environment with a host OS.
